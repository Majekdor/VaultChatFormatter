# VaultChatFormatter

Simple chat formatter plugin, relying on [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/), written by [lucko](https://github.com/lucko) that formats 
the chat, using one template format, and has placeholders for a players prefix/suffix which can be used in the template. I've added a config option to use these
placeholders in join and leave messages.
